# Code for trigger efficiency

*  `fillHistosTnP.C` to create the tree
*  `TnP/tp_Ana_trig.py` to run the tag and probe code
    *  Example: `cmsRun tp_Ana_trig.py GED Data` (to be run in CMSSW_7_5_8_patch4, for instance)
*  `TnP/plot.C` to plot the fits
*  `TnP/TnPEffDraw.C` to plot the efficiencies
